## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The only thing needed to run the code is the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the Airbnb Boston activity dataset to understand customer satisfaction, and what interesting result we can get from analysing the customer reviews.
To do so, this project will answer the below questions:

1. What type of properties are being booked the most?
2. What are the property traits that attract the highest ratings?
3. Is there a relation between the number of bookings of a place and the reviews score?  
4. How reviews for a given property changes through seasons?
5. When in the year customers gives the best reviews?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  As well as folder containing the data used. The dource of the data and more information can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston?select=listings.csv).


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](#).
